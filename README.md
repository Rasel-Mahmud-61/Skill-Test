 #  SKill Test Application 
 

## ğŸ‘‰ Indroduction 

**This is a Skill Application. Each quiz page is created based on a particular video. Every video has its own quiz page with multiple questions available.

I've designed a summary page to provide results and display correct or incorrect answers. This application is developed using React for the frontend and Node.js for the backend. Firebase database is also utilized.**
